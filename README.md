## What is Hazel?

Hazel is an intelligent background application that brings automated file organization to your Mac. It empowers users to create a set of rules that are continuously applied to designated folders, ensuring your digital workspace remains structured and efficient without any ongoing effort.

Imagine automatically sorting incoming invoices into a dedicated folder, renaming vacation photos by date and location, or deleting temporary files that are older than a month. Hazel makes this possible through a robust and user-friendly rule system. You can craft conditions based on file name, type, date, content, and more, then pair them with actions like move, copy, rename, tag, or even run AppleScripts and shell scripts. This flexibility allows for incredibly powerful workflows tailored to your specific needs.

Beyond simple organization, Hazel helps with disk cleanup and can integrate with cloud services, making it an indispensable tool for anyone looking to optimize their digital productivity and maintain a clutter-free Mac environment.
